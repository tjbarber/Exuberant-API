# Exuberant API

Hi there! If you're looking at this you've stumbled upon a beta version of the Exuberant API! The Exuberant API is built on top of [Sails](http://sailsjs.org), a very friendly JavaScript web framework that similar to Ruby on Rails.


### Why is the Exuberant API open source?

It isn't. The beta is open source. The reason it's open source is because I, the creator known as [TorpedoSkyline](https://twitter.com/torpedoskyline), went through the Team Treehouse Techdegree to learn iOS development. It was in here that the idea of Exuberant was created, and I decided to use it as a project in the techdegree.

### Can I use it for my Halo 5 API project?

Feel free! But note that you're not getting the API that Exuberant uses today. It has and will change a lot over the years, as 343 releases Halo 6 and we (maybe someday) incorporate support for Halo Wars 2. This beta version doesn't include any caching system for JSON or images, has no database, etc. This version is *incredibly* simple. It's just a wrapper for the Halo 5 API and the unofficial Xbox Live API. I would recommend starting from scratch because Sails is changing / has changed a lot as well.

### Additional notes:

Exuberant's API is built to be deployed to Heroku. It won't be hard to get it running on whatever platform you wish.

That's pretty much it. Have fun, and happy hacking!
